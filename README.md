# FastBud-Overview 
A python application, using Streamlit framework for a Fasting Monitoring System.
# Features 
This is an intermittent fasting application designed to help users keep track of their fasting periods. It also includes useful information and calculators such as BMI, BMR, and TDEE.
On the homepage, there is a form for users to input their personal data. The 'Fast' page allows users to visualize data about their profile and use a timer to track their fasting periods.
The 'Journal' page enables users to review their fasting history. Within a selected period, they can edit, delete, or manually add a new entry. Additional information, such as total time fasted, total calories burned, and the longest fast, is also available.

The implementation of features such as user authentication and a historical database for each user, providing an even more comprehensive posting experience, will follow soon.
